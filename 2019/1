Safe Grid Search with Optimal Complexity

We revisit the techniques of approximating the regularization path up to predefined tolerance eps in a unified framework and show that its complexity is 
O(1/^d\sqrt(eps)) for uniformly convex loss of order d > 0 and O(1/sqrt(eps)) for Generalized Self-Concordant functions.

cross-validation, see Arlot and Celisse (2010): 
splitting the data in two parts: on the first part (training set) the method is trained for a pre-defined collection of candidates 
ΛT := {λ0, . . . , λT−1}, and on the second part (validation set), the best parameter is selected.

For a piecewise quadratic loss f and a piecewise linear regularization Ω (e.g., the Lasso estimator), 
(Osborne et al., 2000; Rosset and Zhu, 2007) have shown that the set of solutions follows a piecewise 
linear curve w.r.t. to the parameter λ.

generate the full path by maintaining optimality conditions when the regularization param- eter varies: LARS

drawbacks: 
their worst case complexity,
they suffer from numerical instabilities due to multiple and expensive inversion of ill-conditioned matrix.
they lack flexibility when it comes at incorporating different statistical learning tasks because they usually rely on specific algebra to handle the structure of the regularization and loss functions.
they cannot benefit of early stopping.
